# Learn-Rust-through-Spinning-Donut

This is a project for me to learn Rust by creating a spinning donut in the terminal. The goal is to practive Rust's programming language syntax and create a spinning donut project in the terminal. I'll try to just Googling the "math" behind the spinning donut instead of finding the programming solution.

## Build requirements

- Rust compiler.

## Learning log

1. Install Rust compiler.
2. Create a Hello World Program.

To build the program, run ```rustc``` with the file name we wish to build. Then just run the generated executable.
